# **Fullstack Portfolio** #

Hello and welcome to my Fullstack Portfolio section, here you will find some projects that I developed which most of them for self-learning and study purposes so feel free to explore them. 
I hope you enjoy it !

# **About the projects** #

In order to have a better visualization I created this repository to group/migrate my Fullstack projects into a single repository but the original repos still exist separately. Each folder contains a functional project and everything you need to build them, but if you still want to clone the original repos you can find them according the following list:

- [FreshTomatoes project](https://github.com/walternunes/FSDN-P1)
- [MyPortfolio project](https://github.com/walternunes/FSDN-P2)
- [Log Analysis Project](https://github.com/walternunes/FSDN-P3)
- [ItemCatalog Project](https://github.com/walternunes/FSDN-P4)
- [NeighborhoodMap Project](https://github.com/walternunes/FSDN-P5)
- [Enviroment Server Configuration Project](https://github.com/walternunes/FSDN-P6)
